# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

**It's super easy.**

The *easiest* way is to write a post in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Daring Fireball: Markdown Syntax Documentation") and email it to me at [veganstraightedge@gmail.com](mailto:veganstraightedge@gmail.com).

The more self-lead way is to follow these few steps:

* Fork the repo on Github
* Clone that repo on to your computer

    `git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USER-NAME/NoMoreSharecropping.org.git`

* Create a file in `/_posts`
* Name that file using the format of `YYYY-MM-DD-Your-Post-Slug.md`
* At top top of that file include a bit of meta data in YAML.

Like this:

    ---
    layout: post
    title: No More Sharecropping!
    subtitle: Â¡Ya Basta!
    canonical: http://sbb.me/n48f1
    author: Shane Becker
    email: veganstraightedge@gmail.com
    ---

* **REQUIRED FIELDS**: layout, title (if it's different from your file name slug), email, name
* **OPTIONAL FIELDS**: subtitle, canonical (this is the URL of the article on your site if you're reposting an article of yours)

* Write your awesome post!
* Add and commit that file in your local repo `git commit -a "New Blog Post"`
* Push to Github `git push origin gh-pages`
* Send a pull request to me
* That's it!

After your first contribution, you'll get added to the NoMoreSharecropping.org repo as a committer at which point you won't have to do the fork / pull request nonsense.

**Or...** if you're totally awesome and have the site to prove it, send me an email with a link to your previous writing on the subject and I'll just add you as a contributor.

*Let's do this thing!*
